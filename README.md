#### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nm-KTbuUo
#### Description:
This is a full stack web application project to show my skills, projects and experiences. The front-end of the project was developed using React with typescript and it was connected to the back-end using API requests. The back-end consisted of Node.JS, Express.JS and a mongoDB database. 
A custom CMS was also developed for future changes to the content of the portfolio. The front-end of the project is hosted using google firebase and the backend server uses Koyeb for hosting.
