#### Description:Welcome to my Full-Stack Portfolio Website! Here, I showcase my journey as a software developer, highlighting projects that demonstrate my proficiency in a wide range of technologies. For the frontend of the website I used: React, Typescript, Redux, and TailwindCSS and the backend implementation with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, this website encapsulates my passion for creating dynamic and innovative web applications. My initial plan was to develop a web application using the MERN stack as it was very prevalent in the market and I wanted to get familiar with it.
Frontend Technologies:
React: As the foundation of my frontend development, React provides a robust and efficient way to build user interfaces. Leveraging its component-based architecture, I created modular and reusable UI elements that enhance the overall user experience. This was my go-to as I worked with React-Native before and was comfortable with creating applications with modular components.
Typescript: With Typescript, I ensure type safety and improved code maintainability throughout my projects. Its static typing features enable early error detection. This came with a very minimal learning curve as I was already familiar with javascript, I just had to deal with some type errors in the beginning but got used to it by the end of the project.
Redux: For state management, Redux offers a centralized approach that simplifies data flow and synchronization across components. This was crucial as I was displaying data from the backend in different components so having 1 API call and setting the state helped in simplifying the code base. 
TailwindCSS: TailwindCSS assisted in designing responsive and visually appealing layouts with minimal CSS code. Its utility-first approach facilitates rapid prototyping and customization, allowing me to focus on functionality rather than styling. 
Aceternity and Next UI: As this website would be used as an introduction to my skills and experiences, I wanted to make it visually appealing for the user. I researched around for a lot of different UI libraries and was impressed by the components that Aceternity and Next UI provided. After choosing the UI library I was going to use I had to decide a color theme for the website, this part took a long time, a lot of staring at other websites and analyzing colors that would complement each other nicely. Finally I was able to fix on a dark navy background and orange for the secondary color while keeping the text white. The components in Next UI were easier to use but harder to customize as they were all imports but with Aceternity UI I had the ability to customize the components more but that meant I also had to read and understand the code for the component. 
Firebase Storage: I used firebase storage to store some of the dynamic pictures used in the website. Firebase allowed a robust storage solution which would store the image in a cloud and provide a link to access it. The link would then be stored in my MongoDB database for displaying it on the site.
Vite: As a modern build tool, Vite enhances the development workflow by offering fast, optimized builds and hot module replacement. Its seamless integration with React and Typescript enables efficient code compilation and bundling, resulting in improved performance and productivity.
React Router DOM: For client-side routing, React Router DOM provides a declarative way to define navigation paths and manage application state. This was used for seamless routing to the admin panel and main page.
Backend Technologies:
Node.js: As a lightweight and scalable runtime environment, Node.js powers the server-side logic of my web applications. It was used to create API endpoint for displaying, editing and deleting data from the MongoDB database.
Express.js: Built on top of Node.js, Express.js provides a minimalist framework for building web servers and APIs. Its modular design and middleware support simplify route handling, request processing, and error management, enabling rapid development of backend services.
MongoDB: As a NoSQL database, MongoDB offers flexibility and scalability for storing and retrieving data in JSON-like documents. Its schema-less nature accommodates evolving data structures and facilitates seamless integration with Node.js and Express.js, making it a preferred choice for modern web applications.
Hosting:
Finally, when it came to hosting I searched around for hosting platforms that provide free service. For the front-end I was satisfied with the solution firebase provided as I was also using it for storage. For backend hosting I found Koyeb which provided a free hosting service for limited usage, for my case this worked perfectly. 
In conclusion, my Full-Stack Portfolio Website serves as a testament to my expertise in frontend and backend development, utilizing cutting-edge technologies to deliver innovative solutions. Whether it's building intuitive user interfaces, implementing scalable backend services, or integrating hardware components with software systems, I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of web development and creating impactful applications that drive positive change. Thank you for visiting, and I invite you to explore my projects further to witness the depth and breadth of my capabilities as a software developer.
